## Clop ransomware

 - [**Resource decoder**](https://github.com/danzek/ransomware-sucks/tree/master/clop/decoder) &mdash; Decodes resources embedded in executable.

I am not able to share the decrypter at this time, but I will note that the keys are hardcoded into the binaries and the decrypter is floating around on some malware-sharing sites. Remember that you can derive the public key from a private key, and the keys are not obfuscated in any way inside the binaries I've seen for Clop *so far*.
